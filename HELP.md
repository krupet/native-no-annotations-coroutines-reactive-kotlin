# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The native build tools is not configured with the Kotlin DSL, check [the documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/0.10.4/reference/htmlsingle/#_add_the_native_build_tools_plugin) for more details.
* The original package name 'com.pkrutsiuk.native-no-annotations-coroutines-reactive-kotlin' is invalid and this project uses 'com.pkrutsiuk.nativenoannotationscoroutinesreactivekotlin' instead.

## Spring Native

This project has been configured to let you generate either a lightweight container or a native executable.

### Lightweight Container with Cloud Native Buildpacks
If you're already familiar with Spring Boot container images support, this is the easiest way to get started with Spring Native.
Docker should be installed and configured on your machine prior to creating the image, see [the Getting Started section of the reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/0.10.4/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-buildpacks).

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm native-no-annotations-coroutines-reactive-kotlin:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM native-image compiler should be installed and configured on your machine, see [the Getting Started section of the reference guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/0.10.4/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-native-build-tools).

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./gradlew nativeBuild
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ build/native-image/native-no-annotations-coroutines-reactive-kotlin
```
